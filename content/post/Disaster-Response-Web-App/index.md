title: Disaster Response Web App
description: Disaster Response Web Application is a Web app that can help emergency organizations analyze incoming messages and classify the messages into specific categories (e.g. Water, Food, Hospitals, Aid-Related) during a disaster event. The app is based on Nature Language Processing and Random Forest Classifier ML model. The data was collected by Figure Eight and provided by Udacity.

*Disaster Response Web Application* is a Web app that can help emergency organizations analyze incoming messages and classify the messages into specific categories (e.g. Water, Food, Hospitals, Aid-Related) during a disaster event. The app is based on Nature Language Processing and Random Forest Classifier ML model. The data was collected by Figure Eight and provided by Udacity.


The techniques I used in this project include:

- SQLite in Python
- Bag of Words (BOW)
- Multilabel classification
- Build Machine Learning Pipeline
- Grid Search Cross Validation
- Random Forest Classifier
- K nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Build a Flask web app 

> You can find the full analysis in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/iamjohnnyli/disaster-response-web-app).

## Data
The data files associated with this project are from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/)

- messages.csv: FIgure Eight provide 26,248 messages
- categories.csv: Raw categories data, total 36 categories.

## Project Process

1. ETL Pipeline
    - Loads `messages` and `categories` dataset
    - Clean data
    - Feature Engineering
    - Stores it in a SQLite database

2. ML Pipeline
    - Loads data from the SQLite database
    - text processing and machine learning pipeline
    - Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
    - Exports the model

3. Build web app
    - Create HTML templates
    - Build Flask web application
