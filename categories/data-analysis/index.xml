One of the recurring subjects of NLP is to understand customer opinion through statement analysis of customer reviews. However, Basic Sentimental Classification can only tell customers' overall impression about the product. It can&amp;rsquo;t tell customers' opinions of specific features of the product. But, if we dive deeper into the customer reviews, we can get more information. My goal is to extract features from reviews, identify each feature&amp;rsquo;s opinion, quantify the sentiment using econometrics, and then generate a price strategy based on it.</description></item><item><title>Identify Customer Segments</title><link>https://lijohnny.com/p/identify-customer-segments/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 21:42:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://lijohnny.com/p/identify-customer-segments/</guid><description>This is one of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project. This project aims to identify segments of the population from the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. Therefore, these segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected rate of returns.
The techniques I used in this project include:
Data cleaning Encoding and processing mixed-type feature Feature Scaling and Dimensionality Reduction Clustering Performance improvement with OpenBLAS You can find the full analysis in my GitHub repo.</description></item><item><title>Donors Identification for CharityML</title><link>https://lijohnny.com/p/donors-identification-for-charityml/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 01:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lijohnny.com/p/donors-identification-for-charityml/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://lijohnny.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>In this project, I built machine learning models that best identifies potential donors for CharityML(a fictitious charity organization) with data collected for the U.S. census. To find the best approach, I performed EDA, feature engineering, and building training and predicting pipeline to evaluate and optimize the performance between different machine learning models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid&amp;rdquo;,&lt;/em> by Ron Kohavi.
