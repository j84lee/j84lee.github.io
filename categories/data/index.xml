Most of the email services have spam filters that can help us block and filter out most of the emails with commercial, fraudulent and malicious content. The purpose of the project is to explore and analyze the email header to identify the features that can tell us which emails are malicious.
This is the Part 2 of the series.

The correctness and reproducibility are also important for scientific research. A consistent environment is critical for reproducibility. There are several ways to achieve that. However, I find out using Docker at any time can repeat the experiment in the same environment. It is easy to scale up and scale horizontally.
My docker image is based on Ubuntu. It includes common Data Science tools such as Jupyter Notebook wiht Python 3 and R kernel.</description></item></channel></rss>
