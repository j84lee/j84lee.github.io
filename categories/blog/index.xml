So, the beginning of the file usually looks like this:
import xxxx as xxx from xxxx import xxxx Importing packages is one of my least favorite parts when I&amp;rsquo;m working on a Data Scientist project. Packages like pandas, numpy, lighteda, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn are commonly used for my projects. I need to repeat this step in every single Jupyter Notebook.</description></item><item><title>Switch from Hexo to Hugo</title><link>https://lijohnny.com/p/switch-from-hexo-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 20:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lijohnny.com/p/switch-from-hexo-to-hugo/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a year since last time I update my blog. Recently, I want to get back to writing blog again. However, I encounter some issues.
Hexo, the static web generator I used, was not compatible with current node.js version in my system.

&lt;p>As you can see, my blog contains cover images. Every time I write an article I need to upload a cover image to the image server. However, the process is complicated and trivial. I need to crop the image to a certain proportion and resize and compress the image to reduce the loading time.

Therefore, I create two python scripts to automate the process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solve the Problem in a April Fool's Joke</title><link>https://lijohnny.com/p/solve-the-problem-in-a-april-fools-joke/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2019 14:35:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lijohnny.com/p/solve-the-problem-in-a-april-fools-joke/</guid><description>On April 1st, one of the post on v2ex (An online community of developers and designers in China1) become viral.
