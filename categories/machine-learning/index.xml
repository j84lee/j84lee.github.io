The app is based on Nature Language Processing and Random Forest Classifier ML model. The data was collected by Figure Eight and provided by Udacity.

One of the recurring subjects of NLP is to understand customer opinion through statement analysis of customer reviews. However, Basic Sentimental Classification can only tell customers' overall impression about the product. It can&amp;rsquo;t tell customers' opinions of specific features of the product. But, if we dive deeper into the customer reviews, we can get more information. My goal is to extract features from reviews, identify each feature&amp;rsquo;s opinion, quantify the sentiment using econometrics, and then generate a price strategy based on it.</description></item><item><title>Identify Customer Segments</title><link>https://lijohnny.com/p/identify-customer-segments/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 21:42:22 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://lijohnny.com/p/identify-customer-segments/</guid><description>This is one of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project. This project aims to use unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population from the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. Therefore, these segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences with the highest expected rate of returns.
